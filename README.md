# mental-health-filters

This repository contains the implementations of machine learning models designed to detect social media users diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The goal of this project is to provide an automated tool for identifying individuals who may be at risk based on their social media activity and language patterns. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to contribute to mental health awareness and early detection.
